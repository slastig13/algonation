// Prompt: write a Binary Search Tree class. The class should have a "value" property set to be an integer, as well as "left" and "right" properties, both of which should point to either the None (null) value or to another BST. The BST class should support insertion, searching, and removal of values. The removal method should only remove the first instance of the target value.
