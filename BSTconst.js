// Prompt: write a Binary Search Tree class. The class should have a "value" property set to be an integer, as well as "left" and "right" properties, both of which should point to either the None (null) value or to another BST. The BST class should support insertion, searching, and removal of values. The removal method should only remove the first instance of the target value.

class BST {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }

  insert(value) {
    // Write your code here.
    // Do not edit the return statement of this method.
    return this;
  }

  contains(value) {
    // Write your code here.
  }

  remove(value) {
    // Write your code here.
    // Do not edit the return statement of this method.
    return this;
  }
